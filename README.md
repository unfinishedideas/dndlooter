# D&D Loot Generator

This gives DMs an easy way to determine random loot. It will include a front facing interface to view the results on.  
All of this can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide in Chapter 7: Treasure.

## Still to do

~~Add random magic item function.~~  
Add magic items into tables.  
Add hoard items into tables.  
Clean up getLoot hoard section.  
Make the interface not ugly. (find a way to gracefully display lists of items, their total value and the value of the coinage found)

## Potential wanted features

Random Mundane Items  
More randomness to currency generation  
Imagery
